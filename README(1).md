# Atliq Mart Supply Chain FMCG Project

Developed Supply Chain Analytics Challenge in FMCG Domain



## Acknowledgements

The FMCG supply chain management project provides valuable insights into the domain of supply chain management in the FMCG industry. Key terms such as OT (On Time), OTIF (On Time In Full), IF (In Full), LIFR (Line Fill Rate), and VOFR (Volume Fill Rate) enhance the understanding of this industry-specific domain. Moreover, the project sheds light on the challenges associated with product delivery and identifies factors contributing to delays. We extend our gratitude to Codebasics and their team for recognizing and addressing this significant challenge. Their efforts have greatly contributed to the advancement of knowledge in this field.
## Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer based in the state of Gujrat. It is facing issues in providing proper customer service, like the deliveries being delayed and not being made in full. So, it wants the Supply Chain Analytics team to track the service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can swiftly respond to these issues. 
## About Data

For this project, we utilized data from the Atliq Mart spanning the period of March 2022 to August 2022. In our analysis, we focused on key performance indicators such as OT (On Time), OTIF (On Time In Full), IF (In Full), LIFR (Line Fill Rate), and VOFR (Volume Fill Rate). Our examination included evaluating product delivery issues and utilizing accompanying visuals to identify areas with the highest impact or delays.

Throughout the project, we emphasized Total Order Line, Total Undelivered Quantity, and the current status of deliveries in each state as significant KPIs. By leveraging this information, we were able to identify common locations, customer names, and the top five products associated with late deliveries. These specific areas were central to our project implementation and analysis.
